First run:
sudo docker run --rm --name ecoserver-dev_01 -v ecoserver-dev_data:/opt/eco -it venopsis/ecoserver-dev:latest Init
Get bash in foreground.
When config done, just press ctrl^d to leave container -> will be stopped and removed but not the volume (keep config)

Second run:
sudo docker run --name ecoserver-dev_01 -v ecoserver-dev_data:/opt/eco -d venopsis/ecoserver-dev:latest
This will run the container in detached mode (background) with the ecoserver starting and loading config files from the attached volume.

Manage the server:
The eco server will run in tmux session. Then you can connect to the container as following:
sudo docker exec -it ecoserver-dev_01 bash
Type the following command to access ecoserver tmux instance and see log.
root@containerName:/opt/eco# tmux at -t ecoserver
If you want to edit files, etc simply continue in the bash command that showed up.

Leave the server:
From bash : ctrl^d
From tmux : ctrl^b + d
